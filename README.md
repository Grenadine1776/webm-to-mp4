## Building Executables

Create standalone executables for distribution:

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run build

# Build for specific platforms
npm run build-win    # Windows
npm run build-mac    # macOS
npm run build-linux  # Linux

# Create installer packages
npm run dist
```

Built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Configuration

The application uses sensible defaults, but you can customize:

- **Video Quality**: Ranges from 500 kbps (low) to 5000 kbps (very high)
- **Frame Rates**: 24 fps (cinematic), 30 fps (standard), 60 fps (smooth)
- **Resolutions**: Original, 480p, 720p HD, 1080p Full HD
- **Audio Codecs**: AAC (recommended), MP3 (compatible), Copy (preserve original)

## FFmpeg Setup

The application requires FFmpeg for video conversion. If FFmpeg is not found:

### Windows

1. Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`)
3. Add the `bin` folder to your system PATH

### macOS

```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install ffmpeg

# Using MacPorts
sudo port install ffmpeg
```

### Linux

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install ffmpeg

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"FFmpeg not found" error**

- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and in your system PATH
- Restart the application after installing FFmpeg

**Files not converting**

- Check that input files are valid WebM format
- Ensure you have write permissions to the output folder
- Try with a different output location

**Application won't start**

- Verify Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check the console for error messages

**Slow conversion**

- Lower the quality setting for faster processing
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Consider using original resolution instead of upscaling

### Getting Help

1. Check the [Issues page](../../issues) for known problems
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Your operating system and version
